# Self-hosting

## We Support Self-hosting

We understand the importance of privacy and control over your own data. That's why we fully support self-hosting for those who have a basic understanding of technology or Docker. By self-hosting our application, you can ensure extra privacy and have full control over your data.

## How to Self-host

There are two methods to self-host our application:

### Using Docker and Our Install Script

This is the easiest method. Our installation script automates the entire setup process for you. Here are the steps:

TODO: 
- create docker-compose file
- create installation script
- create step-by-step guide

### Completely Self-managed

This method gives you full control over the setup and configuration. It requires PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, and OpenSearch 2. Here are the steps:

1. Install and configure PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, and OpenSearch 2.
2. download the latest release from our GitHub repository.
3. Configure the `.env` file.
4. Run the application.
